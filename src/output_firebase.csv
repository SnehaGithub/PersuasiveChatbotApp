Vaping involves inhaling and exhaling vapor produced by an electronic cigarette or other devices such as vape pens or mods. The vapor typically contains nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals. Vaping is often promoted as a safer alternative to smoking traditional cigarettes since it doesn't involve combustion and the harmful byproducts of burning tobacco. However, vaping still poses health risks, including potential exposure to toxic chemicals and nicotine addiction. It's important to understand the potential risks and benefits of vaping and make informed decisions about your health.",Chatbot,2024-04-18 19:32:01
